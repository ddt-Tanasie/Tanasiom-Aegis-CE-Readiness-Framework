WHAT'S NEW IN THIS VERSION (v3.3)
- Definition for 'cloud services' provided

- Updated definition for Passwordless Authentication to include FIDO2

- Definitive statement that cloud services cannot be excluded from scope

- Software Security Code of Practice introduced in Software Development section

- Scope criteria no longer refers to 'untrusted connections'

- Importance of backing up data is emphasised

A. INTRODUCING THE TECHNICAL CONTROLS
Full Text:
We have organised the requirements under five technical controls:

1. Firewalls
2. Secure Configuration
3. Security Update Management
4. User Access Control
5. Malware Protection

As a Cyber Essentials scheme applicant organisation, it's your 
responsibility to make sure that your organisation meets all the 
requirements. You might also be required to supply evidence before 
your Certification Body can award certification at the level for which 
you're applying.

What you should do first:

- Establish the boundary of scope for your organisation, and then 
  determine what is in scope within this boundary.

- Review each of the five technical control themes and the controls 
  they embody as requirements.

- Take the necessary steps to ensure that your organisation meets 
  every requirement it needs for the scope you have determined.
Key Takeaway for Your Project:

These 5 controls = framework for entire toolkit
Your questionnaire must cover all 5
Your templates map to these 5 areas


B. DEFINITIONS
Full Text:
Applicant refers to the organisation which is seeking certification, 
or sometimes the individual who is acting as the main point of 
contact, depending on context

Cloud service means an on-demand, scalable service, hosted on shared 
infrastructure, and accessible via the internet. For the purposes of 
Cyber Essentials, a cloud service will be accessed via an account 
(which may be credentials issued by your organisation, or an email 
address used for business purposes), and will store or process data 
for your organisation

A corporate VPN is a virtual private network that connects back to 
your office location, or to a virtual or cloud firewall. You must 
administer the VPN so that you can apply the firewall controls

Devices includes all types of hosts, networking equipment, servers, 
networks, and end user devices such as desktop computers, laptops, 
thin clients, tablets and smartphones - whether physical or virtual

Licensed and supported software is software that you have a legal 
right to use and that a vendor has committed to support by providing 
regular vulnerability fixes. The vendor must provide the future date 
when they will stop providing these. (Note that the vendor doesn't 
need to have created the software originally, but they must be able 
to modify the original software to create fixes)

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is a method of authenticating a 
user which uses two or more verification factors

Organisational data includes any electronic data belonging to your 
organisation, for example, emails, documents, database data, 
financial data

Organisational service includes any software applications, cloud 
applications, cloud services, user interactive desktops and mobile 
device management (MDM) solutions that your organisation owns or 
subscribes to. For example: web applications, Microsoft 365, Google 
Workspace, mobile device management containers, Citrix Desktop, 
Virtual Desktop solutions or IP telephony

Passwordless authentication is a method to establish a user's 
identity that uses a factor other than knowledge. Examples include 
but are not limited to: FIDO2 authenticators, biometric data, 
security keys or tokens, one-time codes, QR codes, and push 
notifications.

Scope means the networks, hardware and software assets, and cloud 
services that are included in the assessment

Servers are devices that provide organisational data or services to 
other devices as part of your organisation's business

Software includes operating systems, commercial off-the-shelf 
applications, extensions, interpreters, scripts, libraries, network 
software and firewall and router firmware

A sub-set is part of the organisation whose network is segregated 
from the rest of the organisation by a firewall or VLAN

Vulnerability fixes include patches, updates, registry fixes, 
configuration changes, scripts or any other mechanism approved by 
the vendor to fix a known vulnerability
Why These Matter for Your Project:

Device Inventory template must capture all "devices"
Software Inventory must track all "software"
Cloud services questionnaire questions
These definitions = language to use in your templates


C. BACKING UP YOUR DATA
Full Text:
Backing up your data is not a technical requirement of Cyber 
Essentials. However, we highly recommend implementing an appropriate 
backup solution.

Backing up means creating a copy of your information and saving it 
to another device or to cloud storage (online).

Backing up regularly means you will always have a recent version of 
your information saved. This will help you recover quicker if your 
data is lost or stolen.

If automatic backups are available, you should consider turning them 
on. This will regularly save your information into cloud storage, 
without you having to remember.

If you back up your information to a USB stick or an external hard 
drive, disconnect it from your computer when a backup isn't being 
done.
Opportunity for Your Toolkit:

Even though NOT required by CE, you could include backup guidance
Shows value-add beyond minimum compliance
Common SME mistake = no backups (ransomware disaster)


D. SCOPE
Cyber Essentials Scope Overview
Full Text:
Your assessment and certification should cover the whole of the IT 
infrastructure used to carry out your organisation's business, or if 
necessary, a well-defined and separately managed sub-set. Either way, 
you must clearly define the scope boundary, namely: the business 
unit managing it, the network boundary and physical location. You 
must agree the scope with the Certification Body before assessment 
begins.

A sub-set can be used to define what is in scope or what is out of 
scope for your Cyber Essentials certification.

Please note: Organisations that choose a scope which includes their 
whole IT infrastructure achieve the best protection and maximise 
their customers' confidence.

Where parts of an organisation's infrastructure have been excluded 
from scope, you will need to justify the reason for a partial scope 
to your assessor.

The requirements apply to all devices and software in scope and which 
meet any of these conditions:

- can accept incoming network connections from internet-connected 
  devices

- can establish outbound connections to devices via the internet

- control the flow of data between any of the above devices and the 
  internet

A scope that doesn't include end-user devices isn't acceptable.

If your organisation's data or services are hosted on cloud services, 
these services must be in scope. Cloud services cannot be excluded 
from scope.
Critical Points:

End-user devices MANDATORY in scope
Cloud services CANNOT be excluded
Must define boundary clearly
Partial scope needs justification

For Your Project:

Your questionnaire must cover end-user devices
Must include cloud service questions (M365, Google Workspace, etc.)
Gap analysis identifies incomplete scoping


Asset Management and Cyber Essentials
Full Text:
Asset management isn't a specific Cyber Essentials control, but 
effective asset management can help meet all five controls, so it 
should be considered as a core security function.

Most business operations depend on some aspect of asset management, 
and cyber security shouldn't be considered in isolation, or as the 
primary consumer of asset information. These functions include IT 
operations, financial accounting, managing software licences, 
procurement and logistics. They may not all need the same information, 
but there will be overlaps and dependencies between the respective 
requirements. Integrating and coordinating asset management across 
your organisation will help reduce or manage any conflicts between 
these functions.

Effective asset management doesn't mean making lists or databases 
that are never used. It means creating, establishing and maintaining 
authoritative and accurate information about your assets that enables 
both day-to-day operations and efficient decision making when you 
need it. In particular, it will help you track and control devices as 
they're introduced into your business.

The NCSC has comprehensive guidance for organisations on asset 
management.
Why This Matters:

Justifies your Device Inventory Template
SMEs often lack proper asset management
CE compliance requires knowing what you have
Gap you're addressing with toolkit

Quote for Literature Review:

"Effective asset management doesn't mean making lists or databases that are never used. It means creating, establishing and maintaining authoritative and accurate information about your assets that enables both day-to-day operations and efficient decision making when you need it."


(i) Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)
Full Text:
In addition to mobile or remote devices owned by the organisation, 
user-owned devices which access organisational data or services (as 
defined above) are in scope. However, all mobile or remote devices 
used only for the purpose of:

- native voice applications
- native text applications
- multi-factor authentication (MFA) applications are out of scope.

Traditionally, user devices were managed centrally, which ensured 
consistency across the organisation. Certifying security controls in 
this way is more straightforward as there is a standard build or 
reference.

BYOD complicates matters, as users are given more freedom to 
'customise' their experience making consistent implementation of the 
controls more challenging. Using the organisational data and services 
definitions to enforce strong access policies should remove some of 
this ambiguity.

For further information and advice on the use of BYOD please see the 
NCSC's guidance.
Key Points:

BYOD accessing org data/services = IN SCOPE
Exception: devices ONLY for voice/text/MFA = OUT OF SCOPE
BYOD complicates compliance

Quote for Literature Review:

"BYOD complicates matters, as users are given more freedom to 'customise' their experience making consistent implementation of the controls more challenging."

For Your Project:

Questionnaire must ask about BYOD usage
Guide needed on managing BYOD securely
Common SME challenge = toolkit addresses this


(ii) Home and Remote Working
Full Text:
Our default approach is that all corporate or BYOD home/remote 
working devices used for your organisation's business are in scope 
for Cyber Essentials.

If your organisation gives the home/remote worker a router, that 
router is then also in scope.

All other routers are out of scope which means you need to apply 
Cyber Essentials firewall controls (such as a software firewall) on 
user devices.

If the home/remote worker is using a corporate VPN, their internet 
boundary is on the company firewall or virtual/cloud firewall.
Relevance:

Post-COVID, most SMEs have remote workers
Home routers usually OUT of scope (unless org-provided)
Software firewalls on devices = solution
VPN changes boundary location

For Your Toolkit:

Remote Access Policy template
Firewall guide for home workers
VPN configuration guidance


(iii) Wireless Devices
Full Text:
Wireless devices (including wireless access points) are:

- in scope if they can communicate with other devices via the 
  internet

- out of scope if it's not possible for an attacker to attack 
  directly via the internet (the Cyber Essentials scheme isn't 
  concerned with attacks that can only be launched within the signal 
  range of the wireless device)

- out of scope if they are part of an ISP router at the home or 
  remote location
Simple Rule:

Internet-connected wireless = IN SCOPE
Local-only wireless = OUT OF SCOPE
Home ISP router wireless = OUT OF SCOPE


(iv) Cloud Services
Full Text - Introduction:
If your organisation's data or services are hosted on cloud services, 
these services must be in scope.

For cloud services, the applicant organisation is always responsible 
for ensuring all controls are implemented, but some of the controls 
can be implemented by the cloud service provider. Who implements 
which control depends on the type of cloud service. We consider three 
different types of cloud service:
Three Types Defined:
- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) – the cloud provider delivers 
  virtual servers and network equipment that, much like physical 
  equipment, your organisation configures and manages. Examples of 
  IaaS include Rackspace, Google Compute Engine, or Amazon EC2

- Platform as a Service (PaaS) – the cloud provider delivers and 
  manages the underlying infrastructure, and your organisation 
  provides and manages the applications. Examples of PaaS include 
  Azure Web Apps and Amazon Web Services Lambda

- Software as a Service (SaaS) – the cloud provider delivers 
  applications, and your organisation then configures the services. 
  You must still make sure that the service is configured securely. 
  Examples of SaaS include Microsoft 365, Dropbox and Gmail
Shared Responsibility Table:
Who implements the controls will vary, depending how the cloud 
service is designed. The table below explains who might typically be 
expected to implement each control:

┌────────────────┬─────────────────┬─────────────────┬──────────────┐
│ Requirement    │ IaaS            │ PaaS            │ SaaS         │
├────────────────┼─────────────────┼─────────────────┼──────────────┤
│ Firewalls      │ Both org &      │ Provider        │ Provider     │
│                │ provider        │ (sometimes org) │              │
├────────────────┼─────────────────┼─────────────────┼──────────────┤
│ Secure         │ Both org &      │ Both org &      │ Both org &   │
│ Configuration  │ provider        │ provider        │ provider     │
├────────────────┼─────────────────┼─────────────────┼──────────────┤
│ Security       │ Both org &      │ Both org &      │ Provider     │
│ Update Mgmt    │ provider        │ provider        │              │
├────────────────┼─────────────────┼─────────────────┼──────────────┤
│ User Access    │ Organization    │ Organization    │ Organization │
│ Control        │                 │                 │              │
├────────────────┼─────────────────┼─────────────────┼──────────────┤
│ Malware        │ Both org &      │ Provider        │ Provider     │
│ Protection     │ provider        │ (sometimes org) │              │
└────────────────┴─────────────────┴─────────────────┴──────────────┘

Table 1: Explanation of who may typically implement each control
Contractual Requirements:
In cases where the cloud provider implements one of the controls on 
your behalf, you must make sure that the cloud provider has committed 
to implementing this via contractual clauses or documents referenced 
by contract, such as security statements or privacy statements. Cloud 
providers will often explain how they implement security in documents 
published in their trust centres, referencing a 'shared responsibility 
model.'
Critical for Your Project:

Most SMEs use SaaS (M365, Google Workspace, Dropbox)
Organization always responsible for User Access Control
Must verify provider commitments via contracts
Your questionnaire must ask about cloud services
Your guide must explain shared responsibility

Quote for Literature Review:

"For cloud services, the applicant organisation is always responsible for ensuring all controls are implemented, but some of the controls can be implemented by the cloud service provider."


(v) Accounts Used by Third Parties and Managed Infrastructure
Full Text:
All accounts that your organisation owns are in scope, even when 
those accounts are used by a third party, such as a supplier, 
contractor or Managed Service Provider (MSP) to manage or support 
your infrastructure.

If you're using externally managed services (such as remote 
administration), you must be able to confirm that the Cyber 
Essentials technical controls are being met and be able to 
demonstrate this in your assessment answers.
SME Challenge:

Many SMEs use MSPs for IT support
MSP uses admin accounts on SME systems
SME still responsible for those accounts meeting CE
Your toolkit must address third-party account management


(vi) Devices Used by Third Parties
Full Text - Table:
All end user devices your organisation owns that are loaned to a 
third party must be included in the assessment scope.

For devices not owned by your organisation, the table below explains 
what is in and out of scope:

┌──────────────────────┬─────────────────┬─────────────────┬──────┐
│ Role                 │ Owned by your   │ Owned by a      │ BYOD │
│                      │ organisation    │ third party     │      │

Table 2: What is in and out of scope for devices not owned by your 
organisation

Key: ✓ In scope  ✘ Out of scope
Additional Note:
For devices out of scope of the assessment, your organisation is 
still responsible for confirming that the devices interacting with 
organisational services and data are configured correctly. It's up to 
you how to achieve this, as it falls outside of the assessment scope.
Your Device Inventory Template:

Must capture org-owned devices
Must capture employee BYOD
Can note third-party devices (but out of scope)


(vii) Software Development
Full Text:
Publicly available commercial web applications (rather than apps 
developed in-house) are in scope by default. Bespoke and custom 
components of web applications are out of scope. The best way to 
mitigate vulnerabilities in applications is robust development and 
testing in line with commercial best practice. See the Software 
Security Code of Practice for further details.
Relevance:

Off-the-shelf web apps = IN SCOPE
Custom-built apps = OUT OF SCOPE
SMEs mostly use commercial apps (low concern)


E. REQUIREMENTS BY TECHNICAL CONTROL THEME

CONTROL 1: FIREWALLS
Header Information:
Applies to: boundary firewalls, desktop computers, laptops, routers, 
servers, IaaS, PaaS, SaaS
Aim
To make sure that only secure and necessary network services can be 
accessed from the internet.
Introduction
All devices run network services to allow them to communicate with 
other devices and services. By restricting access to these services, 
you reduce your exposure to attacks. You can do this using firewalls 
or network devices with firewall functionality. For cloud services, 
you can achieve this using data flow policies.

A boundary firewall is a network device which can restrict the 
inbound and outbound network traffic to services on its network of 
computers and mobile devices. It can help protect against cyber 
attacks by implementing restrictions, known as 'firewall rules,' 
which can allow or block traffic depending on its source, destination 
and type of communication protocol.

Alternatively, if your organisation doesn't control the network to 
which a device connects, you must configure a software firewall on 
the device. This works in the same way as a boundary firewall but 
only protects the single device on which it's configured. This 
approach allows for more tailored rules and means that the rules 
apply to the device wherever it's used. But you should note that this 
creates a greater administrative overhead when managing firewall 
rules.
Requirements
You must protect every device in scope with a correctly configured 
firewall (or network device with firewall functionality).

Information: Most desktop and laptop operating systems now come with 
a software firewall pre-installed, we advise that these are turned on 
in preference to a third-party firewall application.

For all firewalls (or network devices with firewall functionality), 
your organisation must:

- change default administrative passwords to a strong and unique 
  password (see password-based authentication) – or disable remote 
  administrative access entirely

- prevent access to the administrative interface (used to manage 
  firewall configuration) from the internet, unless there is a clear 
  and documented business need, and the interface is protected by one 
  of the following controls:
  
  o multi-factor authentication (see MFA details below)
  
  o an IP allow list that limits access to a small range of trusted 
    addresses combined with a properly managed password 
    authentication approach

- block unauthenticated inbound connections by default

- ensure inbound firewall rules are approved and documented by an 
  authorised person, and include the business need in the 
  documentation

- remove or disable unnecessary firewall rules, when they are no 
  longer needed

Make sure you use a software firewall on devices which are used on 
untrusted networks, such as public wifi hotspots.
Requirements Summary - Your Questionnaire Questions:

✅ Every device protected with firewall
✅ Default admin passwords changed OR remote admin disabled
✅ Admin interface NOT accessible from internet (unless MFA or IP allowlist)
✅ Unauthenticated inbound connections blocked by default
✅ Inbound rules approved, documented, business need stated
✅ Unnecessary rules removed/disabled promptly
✅ Software firewall on devices using untrusted networks

Your Templates Needed:

Firewall Configuration Checklist
Firewall Rules Documentation Template


CONTROL 2: SECURE CONFIGURATION
Header Information:
Applies to: servers, desktop computers, laptops, tablets, mobile 
phones, thin clients, IaaS, PaaS, SaaS
Aim
Ensure that computers and network devices are properly configured to:
- reduce vulnerabilities
- provide only the services required to fulfil their role
Introduction
The default configurations of computers and network devices aren't 
always secure. Standard out-of-the-box configurations often include 
one or more weak points such as:

- an administrative account with a pre-set, publicly known default 
  password or without multi-factor authentication enabled

- pre-enabled but unnecessary user accounts (sometimes with special 
  access privileges)

- pre-installed but unnecessary applications or services

These default installations can allow attackers to gain unauthorised 
access to your organisation's sensitive information.

But by applying some simple technical controls when installing 
computers and network devices, you can minimise vulnerabilities and 
protect against common types of attack.
Requirements
Computers and Network Devices:
Your organisation must proactively manage your computers and network 
devices. You must regularly:

- remove and disable unnecessary user accounts (such as guest 
  accounts and administrative accounts that won't be used)

- change any default or guessable account passwords (see password-
  based authentication)

- remove or disable unnecessary software (including applications, 
  system utilities and network services)

- disable any auto-run feature which allows file execution without 
  user authorisation (such as when they are downloaded)

- ensure users are authenticated before allowing them access to 
  organisational data or services

- ensure appropriate device locking controls (see 'device unlocking', 
  below) for users that are physically present
Device Unlocking Credentials:
If a device requires a user's physical presence to access a device's 
services (such as logging on to a laptop or unlocking a mobile 
phone), a credential such as a biometric, password or PIN must be in 
place before a user can gain access to the services.

You must protect your chosen authentication method (which can be 
biometric authentication, password or PIN) against brute-force 
attacks. When it's possible to configure, you should apply one of the 
following:

- 'throttling' the rate of attempts, so that the length of time the 
  user must wait between attempts increases with each unsuccessful 
  attempt. You should allow no more than 10 guesses in 5 minutes

- locking devices after no more than 10 unsuccessful attempts

When the vendor doesn't allow you to configure the above, use the 
vendor's default setting.

Technical controls must be used to manage the quality of credentials. 
If credentials are just to unlock a device, use a minimum password or 
PIN length of at least 6 characters. When the device unlocking 
credentials are also used for authentication, you must apply the full 
password requirements to the credentials described in User Access 
Controls.
Requirements Summary - Your Questionnaire:

✅ Unnecessary user accounts removed/disabled
✅ Default/guessable passwords changed
✅ Unnecessary software removed/disabled
✅ Auto-run features disabled
✅ Users authenticated before access to org data/services
✅ Device locking controls in place
✅ Brute-force protection: throttling (max 10 in 5 min) OR lockout (after 10 attempts)
✅ Device unlock credential: min 6 characters (if just unlock) OR full password requirements (if also for auth)

CONTROL 3: SECURITY UPDATE MANAGEMENT
Header Information:
Applies to: servers, desktop computers, laptops, tablets, mobile 
phones, firewalls, routers, IaaS, PaaS, SaaS
Aim
Ensure that devices and software are not vulnerable to known security 
issues for which fixes are available.
Introduction
Any device that runs software can contain security flaws, known as 
vulnerabilities.

Vulnerabilities are regularly discovered in all sorts of software. 
Once discovered, malicious individuals or groups move quickly to 
misuse (or 'exploit') vulnerabilities to attack computers and 
networks.

Product vendors provide fixes for vulnerabilities identified in 
products that they still support, in the form of patches, security 
updates, registry fixes, scripts, configuration changes or any other 
mechanism prescribed by the vendor to fix a known vulnerability. 
These may be made available to customers immediately or on a regular 
release schedule (perhaps monthly).
Requirements
You must make sure that all software in scope is kept up to date. All 
software on in-scope devices must:

- be licensed and supported

- be removed from devices when it becomes unsupported, or removed 
  from scope by using a defined sub-set that prevents all traffic to 
  or from the internet

- have automatic updates enabled where possible

- be updated, including vulnerability fixes, within 14 days* of 
  release, where:
  
  o the update fixes vulnerabilities described by the vendor as 
    'critical' or 'high risk'
  
  o the update addresses vulnerabilities with a CVSS v3 base score 
    of 7 or above
  
  o there are no details of the level of vulnerabilities that the 
    update fixes provided by the vendor

Please note: For optimum security we strongly recommend (but it's not 
mandatory) that all released updates are applied within 14 days of 
release.

*It's important that updates are applied as soon as possible. 14 days 
is considered a reasonable period to be able to implement this 
requirement. Any longer would constitute a serious security risk 
while a shorter period may not be practical.

Information: If the vendor uses different terms to describe the 
severity of vulnerabilities, see the precise definition in the Common 
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). For the purposes of the Cyber 
Essentials scheme, 'critical' or 'high risk' vulnerabilities are 
those with a CVSS v3 base score of 7 or above, or are identified by 
the vendor as 'critical or high risk'.

Caution: Some vendors release security updates for multiple issues 
with differing severity levels as a single update. If such an update 
covers any 'critical' or 'high risk' issues then it must be installed 
within 14 days.

CONTROL 4: USER ACCESS CONTROL
Header Information:
Applies to: servers, desktop computers, laptops, tablets, mobile 
phones, IaaS, PaaS, SaaS
Aim
Ensure that user accounts:
- are assigned to authorised individuals only
- provide access to only those applications, computers and networks 
  that the user needs to carry out their role
Introduction
Every active user account in your organisation facilitates access to 
devices and applications, and to sensitive business information. By 
making sure that only authorised individuals have user accounts, and 
that they're only granted as much access as they need to carry out 
their role, you reduce the risk of information being stolen or 
damaged.

Compared to normal user accounts, accounts with special access 
privileges have enhanced access to devices, applications and 
information. If these accounts are compromised, an attacker could 
take advantage of their greater access to corrupt information on a 
large scale, disrupt business processes or gain unauthorised access 
to other devices in the organisation.

Administrative accounts are especially highly privileged, for 
example. These accounts typically allow the user to:

- execute software that can make significant and security-related 
  changes to the operating system

- make changes to the operating system for some or all users

- create new accounts and allocate privileges

All types of administrators will have this kind of account, including 
domain administrators and local administrators.

This is important because if a user opens a malicious URL or email 
attachment, the malware would typically be executed with the same 
privilege level of the user's account. This is why it's important to 
take special care allocating and using privileged accounts.

Example: Jody is logged in with an administrative account. If Jody 
opens a malicious URL or email attachment, any associated malware is 
likely to acquire administrative privileges. Unfortunately, this is 
exactly what happens. Using Jody's administrative privileges, a type 
of malware known as ransomware encrypts all of the data on the 
network and then demands a ransom. The ransomware was able to encrypt 
far more data than would have been possible with standard user 
privileges, making the problem that much more serious.
Requirements
Your organisation must be in control of your user accounts and the 
access privileges that allow access to your organisational data and 
services. It's important to note that this also includes third party 
accounts – for example, accounts used by your support services. You 
also need to understand how user accounts authenticate and manage the 
authentication accordingly.

This means your organisation must:

- have in place a process to create and approve user accounts

- authenticate users with unique credentials before granting access 
  to applications or devices

- remove or disable user accounts when they're no longer required 
  (for example, when a user leaves the organisation or after a 
  defined period of account inactivity)

- implement MFA, where available – authentication to cloud services 
  must always use MFA

- use separate accounts to perform administrative activities only (no 
  emailing, web browsing or other standard user activities that may 
  expose administrative privileges to avoidable risks)

- remove or disable special access privileges when no longer required 
  (when a member of staff changes role, for example)
Requirements Summary - Core:

✅ Process to create/approve user accounts
✅ Authenticate with unique credentials
✅ Remove/disable accounts when no longer needed
✅ MFA where available (MANDATORY for cloud services)
✅ Separate admin accounts (no email/browsing with admin)
✅ Remove privileges when role changes


Passwordless Authentication
Full Text:
Passwordless authentication is a method of verifying identity without 
using traditional passwords.

Common examples of passwordless authentication include:

- Passkeys: Passwordless login technology based on public-key 
  cryptography used to securely authenticate a user. This includes 
  FIDO2 authenticators which are considered as Passkeys. FIDO2 
  authenticators are regarded as MFA because user authentication is 
  performed. FIDO2 is a set of standards that define cryptographic 
  authentication using public key credentials and protocols to 
  provide more secure alternatives to passwords for accessing online 
  services

- Biometric authentication: Uses biological traits of the user such 
  as fingerprints or facial features to confirm their identity

- Security keys or tokens: Physical hardware devices such as USB 
  security keys or smart cards

- Push notifications: A prompt on a smartphone to approve or deny a 
  login attempt

- One-time codes: Temporary codes are sent via email, SMS, or a 
  mobile app

This helps to avoid many of the problems with traditional passwords 
which can be forgotten, stolen, or brute-forced.

Modern alternative to passwords


Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
Full Text:
As well as providing an extra layer of security for passwords that 
aren't protected by the other technical controls, you should always 
use multi-factor authentication to give administrative accounts extra 
security, and accounts that are accessible from the internet.

The password element of the multi-factor authentication approach must 
have a password length of at least 8 characters, with no maximum 
length restrictions.

There are four types of additional factor to consider:

- a managed/enterprise device
- an app on a trusted device
- a physically separate token
- a known or trusted account

Additional factors should be chosen so that they are usable and 
accessible. You might need to carry out user testing to decide what 
is best for your users. For more information see NCSC's guidance on 
MFA.

Information: SMS is not the most secure type of MFA but still offers 
a huge advantage over not using any MFA at all. Any multi-factor 
authentication is better than not having it at all. However, if there 
are alternatives available that will work for your situation, we 
recommend you use these instead of SMS.
MFA Summary:
When Required:

Administrative accounts (ALWAYS)
Accounts accessible from internet (ALWAYS)
Cloud services (MANDATORY)

Password Component:

Min 8 characters (no max)

Additional Factor Types:

Managed/enterprise device
App on trusted device
Physical token
Known/trusted account

SMS Note:

Not ideal but better than nothing
Use alternatives if available

Your Templates:

Questions: "Is MFA enabled on admin accounts?" "Is MFA enabled on cloud services?"


Password-Based Authentication
Full Text:
All user accounts require the user to authenticate.

Where authentication is carried out using a password, you should put 
in place the following protective measures:

- Passwords are protected against brute-force password guessing by 
  implementing at least one of:
  
  o multi-factor authentication (see above)
  
  o 'throttling' the rate of attempts, so that the length of time the 
    user must wait between attempts increases with each unsuccessful 
    attempt. You should allow no more than 10 guesses in 5 minutes
  
  o locking devices after no more than 10 unsuccessful attempts

- Use technical controls to manage the quality of passwords. This 
  will include one of the following:
  
  o Using multi-factor authentication (see above)
  
  o A minimum password length of at least 12 characters, with no 
    maximum length restrictions
  
  o A minimum password length of at least 8 characters, with no 
    maximum length restrictions and use automatic blocking of common 
    passwords using a deny list

- Support users to choose unique passwords for their work accounts 
  by:
  
  o educating people about avoiding common passwords, such as a pet's 
    name, common keyboard patterns or passwords they have used 
    elsewhere. This could include teaching people to use the password 
    generator feature built into some password managers
  
  o encouraging people to choose longer passwords by promoting the 
    use of multiple words (a minimum of three) to create a password 
    (such as the NCSC's guidance on using three random words)
  
  o providing usable secure storage for passwords (for example a 
    password manager or secure locked cabinet) with clear information 
    about how and when it can be used
  
  o not enforcing regular password expiry
  
  o not enforcing password complexity requirements

You should also make sure there is an established process in place to 
change passwords promptly if you know or suspect a password or 
account has been compromised.
Password Requirements Summary:
1. Brute-Force Protection (choose one):

MFA, OR
Throttling (max 10 guesses in 5 minutes), OR
Lockout (after 10 attempts)

2. Password Quality (choose one):

MFA, OR
Min 12 characters (no max), OR
Min 8 characters (no max) + deny list (block common passwords)

3. User Support (all required):

✅ Educate: avoid common passwords, use password managers
✅ Encourage: use 3+ random words
✅ Provide: secure password storage
❌ DON'T enforce regular expiry
❌ DON'T enforce complexity requirements

4. Compromise Process:

✅ Process to change passwords if compromised

Key Numbers:

12 characters = min (without MFA or deny list)
8 characters = min (with MFA or deny list)
3 words = min for memorable passwords
10 guesses in 5 minutes = max for throttling
10 attempts = max before lockout

Your Password Policy Template:

Include these requirements
Explain 3 random words approach
Recommend password managers
State no regular expiry
State no complexity requirements

Your Questionnaire:

"Are passwords min 12 characters OR min 8 + deny list OR MFA enabled?"
"Is brute-force protection in place (MFA/throttling/lockout)?"
"Are users educated about password security?"


CONTROL 5: MALWARE PROTECTION
Header Information:
Applies to: Servers, desktop computers, laptops, tablets, mobile 
phones, IaaS, PaaS, SaaS
Aim
To restrict execution of known malware and untrusted software, from 
causing damage or accessing data.
Introduction
Malware, such as computer viruses, worms and ransomware, is software 
that has been written and distributed deliberately to perform 
malicious actions. Potential sources include: malicious email 
attachments, downloads (including those from application stores), and 
direct installation of unauthorised software.

If a system is infected, your organisation is likely to suffer from 
problems like malfunctioning systems, data loss, or onward infection 
that goes unseen until it causes harm elsewhere.

You can largely avoid the potential for harm by:
- preventing malware from being delivered to devices
- preventing malware from running on devices

Example: Acme Corporation implements code signing alongside a rule 
that allows only vetted applications from the device application 
store to execute on devices. Unsigned and unapproved applications 
will not run on devices. The fact that users can only install trusted 
(allow-listed) applications leads to a reduced risk of malware 
infection.
Requirements
You must make sure that a malware protection mechanism is active on 
all devices in scope. For each device, you must use at least one of 
the options listed below. In most modern products these options are 
built into the software supplied. Alternatively, you can purchase 
products from a third-party provider. In all cases the software must 
be active, kept up to date in accordance with the vendor's 
instructions, and configured to work as detailed below:
OPTION A: Anti-Malware Software
(option for in scope devices running Windows or MacOS including 
servers, desktop computers, laptops)

If you use anti-malware software to protect your device it must be 
configured to:

- be updated in line with vendor recommendations

- prevent malware from running

- prevent the execution of malicious code

- prevent connections to malicious websites over the internet
OPTION B: Application Allow Listing
(option for all in scope devices)

Only approved applications, restricted by code signing, are allowed 
to execute on devices. You must:

- actively approve such applications before deploying them to devices

- maintain a current list of approved applications, users must not be 
  able to install any application that is unsigned or has an invalid 
  signature
Requirements Summary:
Must use ONE of these:
Option A: Anti-Malware (Windows/MacOS)

✅ Updated per vendor recommendations
✅ Prevents malware running
✅ Prevents malicious code execution
✅ Blocks malicious websites

Option B: Application Allow Listing (All Devices)

✅ Approve apps before deployment
✅ Maintain approved apps list
✅ Block unsigned/invalid signature apps

F. FURTHER GUIDANCE
Zero Trust and Cyber Essentials
Full Text:
Network architecture is changing. More services are moving to the 
cloud and use of Software as a Service (SaaS) continues to grow.

At the same time, many organisations are embracing flexible working, 
which means lots of different device types may connect to your 
systems from many locations. It's also increasingly common for 
organisations to share data with their partners and guest users, 
which requires more granular access control policies.

Zero trust architecture is designed to cope with these changing 
conditions by enabling an improved user experience for remote access 
and data sharing.

A zero trust architecture is an approach to system design where 
inherent trust in the network is removed. Instead the network is 
assumed to be hostile, and each access request is verified based on 
an access policy. Confidence in a request is achieved by building 
context, which relies on strong authentication, authorisation, device 
health, and value of the data being accessed.

As organisations move towards zero trust architecture models, we have 
considered it in this context, and are confident that implementing 
the technical controls doesn't prevent you using a zero trust 
architecture as defined by the NCSC guidance.
Relevance:

Modern security trend
CE controls compatible with zero trust
Doesn't conflict with forward-thinking approaches

🎯 HOW TO USE THIS FOR YOUR PROJECT
For Literature Review (Chapter 2):
Quotes to Use:

On the 5 Controls:


"We have organised the requirements under five technical controls: 1. Firewalls, 2. Secure Configuration, 3. Security Update Management, 4. User Access Control, 5. Malware Protection"


On BYOD Complexity:


"BYOD complicates matters, as users are given more freedom to 'customise' their experience making consistent implementation of the controls more challenging."


On Asset Management:


"Effective asset management doesn't mean making lists or databases that are never used. It means creating, establishing and maintaining authoritative and accurate information about your assets that enables both day-to-day operations and efficient decision making when you need it."


On Shared Responsibility:


"For cloud services, the applicant organisation is always responsible for ensuring all controls are implemented, but some of the controls can be implemented by the cloud service provider."


On Scope:


"A scope that doesn't include end-user devices isn't acceptable... If your organisation's data or services are hosted on cloud services, these services must be in scope. Cloud services cannot be excluded from scope."


On Admin Account Risk (Example):


"Jody is logged in with an administrative account... Using Jody's administrative privileges, a type of malware known as ransomware encrypts all of the data on the network... The ransomware was able to encrypt far more data than would have been possible with standard user privileges."


On Passwordless Auth:


"This helps to avoid many of the problems with traditional passwords which can be forgotten, stolen, or brute-forced."

2.2 Cyber Essentials Framework

2.2.1 Overview and Purpose

The UK Government's Cyber Essentials scheme provides a baseline 
standard for information security assurance (NCSC, 2026). The 
framework is organized around five technical controls...

[Quote from Source 1, Page 3]:
"We have organised the requirements under five technical controls: 
1. Firewalls, 2. Secure Configuration, 3. Security Update Management, 
4. User Access Control, 5. Malware Protection" (NCSC, 2026, p.3).

2.2.2 The Five Technical Controls

Each control addresses specific vulnerability areas...

[Firewalls - cite Source 1, Pages 13-14]
The firewalls control aims to "make sure that only secure and 
necessary network services can be accessed from the internet" 
(NCSC, 2026, p.13). Requirements include...

2.2.3 Certification Process

Organizations must demonstrate compliance across all five controls...

**Section 2.3: SME Cybersecurity Challenges**
```
2.3.2 Barriers to Compliance

Several factors complicate CE compliance for SMEs. The NCSC (2026) 
acknowledges that...

[Quote from Source 1, Page 8]:
"BYOD complicates matters, as users are given more freedom to 
'customise' their experience making consistent implementation of 
the controls more challenging" (NCSC, 2026, p.8).

This complexity is exacerbated by remote working arrangements...

**Section 2.4: Gap Analysis**
```
2.4.3 Gap Analysis - What Existing Solutions Don't Provide

While the NCSC provides technical requirements, there is a notable 
gap in practical implementation guidance for SMEs. The requirements 
document states what must be done, but not how to do it in resource-
constrained environments...

[Cite Source 1's requirements but note absence of SME-specific 
implementation guidance]

This gap justifies the need for a readiness toolkit that bridges 
the gap between requirements and implementation...

## 7️⃣ **YOUR METHODOLOGY (Chapter 3)**

### **How Source 1 Informs This:**
```
3.3 Design Methodology

The toolkit design was informed by the official NCSC Cyber 
Essentials requirements (NCSC, 2026). Each of the five technical 
controls forms a distinct module within the toolkit:

1. Firewalls module: Based on requirements outlined in NCSC (2026, 
   pp.13-14)
2. Secure Configuration module: Based on NCSC (2026, pp.14-16)
3. Security Update Management module: Based on NCSC (2026, pp.16-18)
4. User Access Control module: Based on NCSC (2026, pp.18-22)
5. Malware Protection module: Based on NCSC (2026, pp.23-24)

The questionnaire design maps each requirement to a question using 
a four-point scale (YES/PARTIAL/NO/N/A), aligned with the NCSC's 
binary compliance model where requirements must either be met or 
not met...

- ✅ Source 1 = **THE** official CE requirements document
- Provides ALL technical requirements you need to research
- Identifies SME challenges (BYOD, remote working, cloud complexity)

**Objective 2: Design structured readiness workflow aligned with CE controls**
- ✅ Source 1's 5 controls = your workflow structure
- Each control becomes a phase in your workflow
- Requirements become checklist items

**Objective 3: Develop practical toolkit (templates, guides, policies)**
- ✅ Source 1 requirements = content for each template
- Every requirement becomes a section in a guide
- Policy templates based on Source 1 password/access requirements

**Objective 4: Prototype dashboard to visualize readiness**
- ✅ Source 1's 5 controls = your 5 dashboard sections
- Requirements = scoring criteria
- Compliance = visualization (% ready per control)

**Objective 5: Evaluate toolkit using simulated SME case study**
- ✅ Source 1 requirements = evaluation criteria
- Before state = failing requirements
- After state = meeting requirements
- Metrics = % compliance with Source 1

**Objective 6: Reflect on legal, ethical, professional implications**
- ✅ Source 1 informs GDPR discussion (data protection requirements)
- BCS Code of Conduct alignment with responsible cybersecurity
- Professional standards = implementing CE correctly

✅ BOTTOM LINE
Source 1 is not just "a reference" - it IS the foundation of your entire project.
Without Source 1:

❌ No basis for questionnaire questions
❌ No criteria for scoring
❌ No content for templates
❌ No evaluation metrics
❌ No academic grounding

With Source 1:

✅ Every requirement becomes a question
✅ Every control becomes a section
✅ Every rule becomes template content
✅ Every compliance point becomes a metric
✅ Official UK Government source = credibility


Your project literally translates Source 1's requirements into an accessible toolkit for SMEs.
Source 1 = The "what" (requirements)
Your Project = The "how" (implementation toolkit)
That's the integration. Source 1 defines what SMEs must do. Your toolkit shows them how to do it.
Does this make the connection clear? Want me to show integration with other sources you'll need (IASME, SME reports, academic papers)?
